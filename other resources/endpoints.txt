Welcome! All of these endpoints should function properly.

POST    /register (given to us) (takes in a username and password, adds a user and account with 1k to db) (1, 3.1, 3.2)
POST    /login (given to us) (takes in a username and password, returns a largely necessary bearer token) (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)
GET     /accounts (returns logged in user and primary account balance) (4)
GET     /usernames (returns a list of usernames to send money to) (5.1)
GET     /transactions (returns a list of transactions relevant to the user) (6)
GET     /transactions/pending (returns the above, but only pending transactions) (9)
POST    /transactions/send (takes in who we are sending the money to and an amount, returns the transaction id, to, from, amount) (updates balances) (5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9)
POST    /transactions/request (takes in who we are sending the request to and an amount, returns " ") (sets status to pending) (8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4(?!), 8.5, 8.6, 8.7)
GET     /transactions{id} (URL takes in a 4-digit transaction id and returns a full transaction and its details) (7)
PUT     /transactions/{transactionId}/status (does everything in request above, but also permanently closes the transaction and potentially does a balance transfer) (10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)
